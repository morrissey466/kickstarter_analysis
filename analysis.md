# Kickstarting with Excel -  John Morrissey 

## Overview of Project
##### In this project, we are looking at data collected from launches of various products and services on Kickstarter. The launch has a set goal of money to be raised, and the data shows whether that goal was successful. The data will be analysed to determine what factors make a successful launch. We will use pivot tables, graphs, and other excel funtions/tools to take the data and make some useful conclusions. 


### Purpose
##### The Purpose of this project is to gain insightful knowledge on product launches from a large set of data. We will be looking into what makes a launch successful to help guide future launches.    

## Analysis and Challenges

##### Pivot tables and charts are used to get a clearer picture of what factors into sucessful launches. We dive into when the project is launched, and its effects on success. Goals are catagorized to help analyse what goals have a higher chance of success.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 
##### The launch date of goals are broken down into the month of launch to determine if there is seasonality. Product categories and sub-categories are taken into consideration, as different products may have different seasonality effects. For example, a play may have better success in the warmer months when people are traveling, while a new gadget or product may have more success around the holidays while people are buying presents. Possible challenges would be the actual launch date itself. Different product types have different timelines, and the launch date might not be the best indicator when comparing all the categories of products. 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

##### Goals are broken down into 11 categories based off the goal amount. Analysis will then be done to detrime which categories are more successful. Successful, failed, and cancelled goals are broken down into percentages for analysis. A challenge to this would be the categories themselves. We will be breaking the categories into increments of 5,000. Breaking them down into increaments of $10,000 could give us different results. 



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

         Sucessful oucomes are seasonal and peak in May and remaim high through the rest of summer. Failed and cancelled outcomes are less seasonal. If one wants to launch a sucessful outcome, they should do so in the summer months. The proportion of failed/sucessful is higher in October, which would be a bad month to launch. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
        
         In terms of goals, the most successful goals are in the under 10k range and the 35k to 40k range. Goals are much less sucessful above 45k and in between 25k to 35k. If one wants a sucessful goal, they should not make it above 45k. Also, 25k to 30k should be avoided if possible as well. 40k goals have a much higher sucess rate than 50k goals. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?




- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
